# Small Business HACCP Plan Builder

Project that allows users to create small business haccp plans. 

### What are HACCP plans?
HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point.  
It is a written plan that defines the
procedures for maintaining control of
potentially hazardous food at the critical
control points of food preparation or
processing.  
Simply put, it is a plan stating how food is to
be handled so consumers do not get sick.
